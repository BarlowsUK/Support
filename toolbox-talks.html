    <div class="buk-accordion-header">Manual Handling</div>
    <div class="buk-accordion-content">
        <p>Manual handling injuries can have serious implications for the employer and the person who has been injured. They can occur almost anywhere in the workplace and heavy manual labour, awkward postures, repetitive movements of arms, legs and back or previous/existing injury can increase the risk. If the object is too big or too heavy (more than 25 kg) to lift using these techniques, use mechanical assistance.</p>
        <p class="bold-text">What do I have to do?</p>
        <p>To help prevent manual handling injuries in the workplace, you should avoid such tasks as far as possible. However, where it is not possible to avoid handling a load, employers must look at the risks of that task and put sensible health and safety measures in place to prevent and avoid injury. For any lifting activity</p>
        <p class="bold-text">Always take into account:</p>
        <p class="custom-paragraph">1. individual capability</p>
        <p class="custom-paragraph">2. the nature of the load</p>
        <p class="custom-paragraph">3. environmental conditions</p>
        <p class="custom-paragraph">4. training</p>
        <p class="custom-paragraph">5. work organisation</p>

        <p class="bold-text">If you need to lift something manually</p>
        <p class="custom-paragraph">1. Reduce the amount of twisting, stooping and reaching</p>
        <p class="custom-paragraph">2. Avoid lifting from floor level or above shoulder height, especially heavy loads</p>
        <p class="custom-paragraph">3. Adjust storage areas to minimise the need to carry out such movements</p>
        <p class="custom-paragraph">4. Consider how you can minimise carrying distances</p>
        <p class="custom-paragraph">5. Assess the weight to be carried and whether the worker can move the load safely or needs any help – maybe the load can be broken down to smaller, lighter components</p>

        <p class="bold-text">If you need to use lifting equipment</p>
        <p class="custom-paragraph">1. Consider whether you can use a lifting aid, such as a forklift truck, electric or hand-powered hoist, or a conveyor</p>
        <p class="custom-paragraph">2. Think about storage as part of the delivery process – maybe heavy items could be delivered directly, or closer, to the storage area</p>
        <p class="custom-paragraph">3. Reduce carrying distances where possible</p>

    <div class="buk-accordion-content">  
        <p>Under the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012 anyone who may come into contact with asbestos or accidently disturb it needs to be legally trained to asbestos awareness level.</p>
        <p>You will have now completed the UKATA online asbestos awareness training course with Boss.</p>
        <p>This course does not allow you to drill, remove or work with asbestos in any way, it only makes you aware of asbestos.</p>
        <p>Only non-licenced trained asbestos engineers can work with asbestos.</p>
        <p>All commercial buildings built before 2000 should have an asbestos report by law, when you arrive on site you should ask to see this to check if there is any known asbestos where you are working.</p>
        <p class="bold-text">There are two types of report available:</p>
        <p class="custom-paragraph">1. R&D or refurbish and demolition survey that is carried out prior to any refurbishment and demolition works</p>
        <p class="custom-paragraph">2. Management survey that is carried out for specific works</p>
        <p>If they do not have a report you should continue to work with caution and if you suspect any asbestos, stop and contact Nigel Johnson on 07740596048.</p>
        <p>If you believe you have accidently disturbed or been exposed to asbestos stop work, do not move away from the work area and call Nigel Johnson 07740596048.</p>

        <p>All electrical works must be carried out safely. Only live working should be carried out as a last resort and must be recorded in an appropriate risk assessment.</p>
        <p>If you are working on an electrical circuit a locking off device must be used and a notice installed detailing the circuit is locked off and your number available to be contacted.</p>
        <p>If you need to leave a lock off device on site report it to your manager before you leave, he may ask you to physically disconnect the circuit and leave a notice detailing the disconnection.</p>
        <p>No one should be exposed to the potential of receiving and electric shock and safe isolation procedures must be followed.</p>
